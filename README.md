### Date format to Human Readable

This script is used to take the SQL Data-format and convert it into human readable format. For example, we have YYYY-MM-DD to YYYY-MM-DD data range;
however, this does not look great when you are reading it, so you may want May 5-10 or May 5,7-21 (etc.). 

This script was made to iterate through several dates and fix this issue, as date changes are tedious and can be left for an algorithm to implement.
